Event Recommendation System
This project was created as part of the Event RecSys Challenge to explore how recommendation systems can be built and applied in real-world scenarios. The system takes in event data and suggests relevant events to users, simulating the way platforms like Meetup, Facebook Events, or Eventbrite provide personalized recommendations.

Project Overview

Recommendation systems are at the core of many modern applications â€” from suggesting movies on Netflix, products on Amazon, to events on social platforms.
This project demonstrates:
How event data can be structured and used.
The logic behind making recommendations (even without advanced machine learning).
A clean and modular Node.js implementation that can be extended further.
Think of this as a prototype for a real-world event recommendation engine.

Key Highlights
Works with JSON-based event datasets.

Generates synthetic data for testing recommendation scenarios.
Written in JavaScript (Node.js) with simple, readable code.
Educational focus: Helps beginners understand how recommendation logic can be set up step by step.

Dataset
The project uses a JSON file (event_recommendation_data.json) to simulate events.
Each entry may include attributes like:
Event title
Category/type
Location
Date/time
This dataset can easily be extended to reflect real-world event platforms.

Learning Outcomes
By exploring this project, you will:
Understand the basics of recommendation systems.
Learn how to handle and process event data.
See how simple logic can be used to generate recommendations.
Get a foundation to later apply machine learning techniques.

Future Scope
This project can be extended in many exciting ways:
Add content-based filtering (recommend based on event features).
Implement collaborative filtering (recommend based on similar users).
Integrate with a frontend interface to display event suggestions interactively.
Scale the system with real-time APIs.

Acknowledgment:
Developed by me as part of the Event RecSys Challenge, showcasing how simple ideas can grow into impactful real-world systems.
